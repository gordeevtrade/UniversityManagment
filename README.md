University Management System

The University Management System is an all-encompassing educational platform that assists in automating the management processes of a university or college. The application is built around CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling efficient handling of all the necessary data, including student information, faculty details, course offerings, and more.

Key Features:

Student and Faculty Management: Administrators can add, read, update, or delete information about students and faculty members. This includes tracking student enrollment, academic progress, faculty qualifications, courses taught, and schedules.

Course Management: The system allows the management of courses, including creation, scheduling, and allocation. Admins can edit course details, remove outdated ones, or add new courses as per the curriculum requirements.

Admissions and Fee Management: The application streamlines the admissions process from application to enrollment and efficiently manages fee structure, fee payment, and automatic calculation of fines.

Repository Pattern: The system uses the Repository Pattern to create a layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer of the application. This design pattern allows the data in the app to be changed or manipulated without affecting the application's operation.

Reporting System: The system can generate various reports to aid in data-driven decision making for university administrators.

The University Management System is a robust and efficient tool that integrates various functions of an educational institution. Its aim is to simplify administrative tasks, ensure the smooth running of the institution, and ultimately enhance the quality of education provided.
